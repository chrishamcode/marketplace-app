## Architecture Overview

The Phase 2 implementation follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Components**: Reusable UI components organized by feature
- **Pages**: Next.js page components that integrate the UI components
- **API Routes**: Backend endpoints for data operations
- **Lib**: Utility functions and services including AI functionality

The application uses:
- Next.js for the frontend and API routes
- MongoDB for data storage
- TensorFlow.js for AI-powered object detection
- Material UI for the component library
